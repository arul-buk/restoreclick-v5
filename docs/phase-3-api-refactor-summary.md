# Phase 3: API Routes Refactoring - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 3 of the RestoreClickV4 database redesign focused on completely refactoring the API routes to use the new database schema and services. This phase transforms the application from a batch-based approach to a session-based, order-centric architecture with robust background processing.

## Completed Components

- **Order creation** with comprehensive metadata tracking
- **Image processing** from temporary to permanent storage
- **Restoration job creation** for background processing
- **Email queuing** for order confirmation with attachments
- **Robust error handling** with detailed logging

#### Upload Temporary Images (`/app/api/upload-temporary-images/route.ts`)
- **Session-based tracking** replacing batch IDs

- **Success URL** updated to payment-success page

### 2. New Order-Based API Endpoints

#### Order Predictions (`/app/api/orders/[id]/predictions/route.ts`)
- **Replaces batch-based approach** with order-centric queries
- **Real-time Replicate polling** for job status updates
- **Automatic database synchronization** when status changes
- **Restored image saving** when jobs complete
- **Backward compatibility** with existing prediction format
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging

#### Order Status (`/app/api/orders/[id]/status/route.ts`)
- **Complete order overview** with restoration progress
- **Job statistics** (total, completed, failed, processing)
- **Progress percentage** calculation
- **Restored image URLs** for completed jobs
- **Overall status determination** logic
- **Detailed job information** for debugging

#### Photo Sharing (`/app/api/orders/[id]/share/route.ts`)
- **Email queue integration** for reliable delivery
- **Both original and restored images** as attachments
- **Customizable recipient** and personal message
- **Template data preparation** for SendGrid
- **Validation** for completed jobs only
- **Comprehensive logging** and error handling

#### ZIP Downloads (`/app/api/orders/[id]/download/route.ts`)
- **Multiple download types**: all, originals, restored
- **Custom ZIP creation** with selected images
- **StorageService integration** for ZIP generation
- **Expiration handling** for download links
- **GET endpoint** for predefined downloads
- **POST endpoint** for custom selections

### 3. Background Worker System

#### Restoration Worker (`/lib/workers/restoration-worker.ts`)
- **Replicate API integration** for job submission and polling
- **Status synchronization** between Replicate and database
- **Restored image downloading** and storage
- **Order completion detection** and status updates
- **Email queuing** for restoration complete notifications
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging

#### Email Worker (`/lib/workers/email-worker.ts`)
- **Email queue processing** with multiple email types
- **SendGrid integration** for reliable delivery
- **Retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Status tracking** and failure handling
- **Support for** order confirmation, restoration complete, and share emails
- **Attachment handling** for all email types

#### Worker Manager (`/lib/workers/worker-manager.ts`)
- **Centralized worker coordination** and lifecycle management
- **Auto-start in production** environment
- **Status monitoring** and health checks
- **Graceful shutdown** handling

### 4. Database Services Integration

All API routes now use the modular database services:
- **Customer service** for email-based customer management
- **Order service** for order lifecycle management
- **Restoration jobs service** for background job tracking
- **Email queue service** for reliable email delivery
- **Storage service** for all file operations

## Key Architectural Changes

### Session-Based Approach
- **Replaced batch_id** with session_id for better tracking
- **Temporary uploads** linked to sessions before payment
- **Permanent storage** organized by order ID after payment
- **Clean separation** between pre and post-payment states

### Order-Centric Design
- **All operations** centered around order entities
- **Restoration jobs** linked to orders, not batches
- **Email communications** tied to order lifecycle
- **Status tracking** at order level with job details

### Background Processing
- **Asynchronous job processing** for Replicate integration
- **Email queue** for reliable delivery
- **Automatic retry logic** for failed operations
- **Order completion detection** and notifications

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Structured logging** with contextual information
- **Graceful degradation** when services fail
- **Retry mechanisms** with exponential backoff
- **Detailed error responses** for debugging

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- **New API endpoints** require frontend updates
- **Order-based polling** replaces batch-based queries
- **Enhanced status information** available for UI
- **ZIP download** functionality ready for integration

### External Services
- **Stripe webhook** fully integrated with new schema
- **Replicate API** handled by background workers
- **SendGrid emails** queued and processed reliably
- **Supabase storage** managed by StorageService

### Environment Variables Required
```env
# Replicate API
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here

# SendGrid Templates
SENDGRID_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_TEMPLATE_ID=d-xxxxx
