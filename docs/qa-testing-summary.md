  - Environment configuration
  - API route testing
- **Key Features Tested**:
  - Checkout session creation with proper metadata
  - Price ID and session ID validation
  - Error handling for invalid inputs
  - URL generation using environment variables
- **Integration Strategy**: Uses Stripe CLI/ngrok for webhook testing instead of complex mocking

### ⚠️ End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/complete-flow.e2e.test.ts`)
- **Status**: 4/6 tests passing (67%)
- **Passing Tests**:
  - ✅ Upload failure handling
  - ✅ Restoration failure handling with retry logic
  - ✅ Data integrity validation
  - ✅ Performance testing
- **Failing Tests**:
  - ❌ Complete user journey (upload → payment → restoration → email)
  - ❌ Payment webhook failure handling

#### Known Issues
1. **Upload Route Content-Type Issue**: 
   - E2E tests encounter 500 error due to Content-Type multipart/form-data handling in test environment
   - Root cause: NextRequest in test environment doesn't properly handle FormData Content-Type headers
   - Impact: Limited - unit tests cover upload functionality thoroughly

2. **Payment Webhook Event Structure**:
   - Webhook test fails due to undefined event.type property
   - Root cause: Mock event structure doesn't match Stripe webhook event format
   - Impact: Limited - Stripe CLI/ngrok integration provides real webhook testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
- **Mocking Strategy**: Comprehensive mocking of external services (Stripe, SendGrid, Supabase, Storage)
- **Database Testing**: Uses actual database types and schemas for accurate testing
- **Error Scenarios**: Extensive error handling and edge case coverage
- **Performance**: Load testing and concurrency validation

### Integration Testing Approach
- **Stripe Webhooks**: Real Stripe CLI/ngrok integration for authentic webhook event delivery
- **End-to-End Flow**: Complete user journey validation from upload to email notification
- **Data Integrity**: Cross-service data consistency validation
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive failure and retry scenario testing

## Environment Configuration

### Vitest Configuration
All required environment variables are configured in `vitest.config.ts`:
```typescript
env: {
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: 'https://test.supabase.co',
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: 'test_service_role_key',
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: 'sk_test_mock_key',
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: 'whsec_test_mock_secret',
  STRIPE_PRICE_ID: 'price_test_mock_id',
  SENDGRID_API_KEY: 'SG.test_mock_key',
  SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL: 'test@restoreclick.com',
  SENDGRID_WELCOME_TEMPLATE_ID: 'd-test_welcome_template',
  SENDGRID_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_TEMPLATE_ID: 'd-test_order_confirmation_template',
  SENDGRID_RESTORATION_COMPLETE_TEMPLATE_ID: 'd-test_restoration_complete_template',
  SENDGRID_FAMILY_SHARE_TEMPLATE_ID: 'd-test_family_share_template',
  REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: 'r_test_mock_token'
}
```

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Run specific test suites
npx vitest run tests/email.test.ts
npx vitest run tests/restoration.test.ts
npx vitest run tests/payment.test.ts

# Run E2E tests
npx vitest run tests/e2e/complete-flow.e2e.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npx vitest
```

### Stripe Webhook Integration Testing
For comprehensive webhook testing with real Stripe events:

1. **Install Stripe CLI**: Follow instructions in `docs/stripe-webhook-testing.md`
2. **Setup ngrok**: For local webhook endpoint exposure
3. **Run Integration Tests**: Use provided scripts for real webhook event delivery

## Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage Summary
- **Total Unit Tests**: 36/36 passing (100%)
