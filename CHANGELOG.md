## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Fixed TypeScript Type Issues**: Resolved all TypeScript type errors in the payment success page components, ensuring type safety and proper prop validation.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling for API calls in the payment success flow, providing better user feedback when operations fail.
- **Fixed ZIP Download**: Addressed issues with ZIP file creation and downloading multiple photos, ensuring all images are properly included and named.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Fixed layout issues on mobile devices, particularly with the before-after slider and action buttons.
- **Email Sharing**: Resolved issues with the email sharing functionality, ensuring proper validation and error handling.
- **Critical Polling Issues**: Fixed multiple polling instances, connection error handling, and memory leaks
  - Prevents multiple polling instances from running simultaneously
  - Adds exponential backoff for connection errors (max 5 consecutive errors before stopping)
  - Implements proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - Adds connection-specific error messages for better user experience
  - Stops polling gracefully when server is unavailable
- **Critical polling loop issue**: Resolved infinite polling caused by database synchronization lag between Replicate completion and local database updates
- **Database sync mechanism**: Manual trigger of Replicate webhook endpoints (`/api/replicate/predictions/[id]`) successfully updated prediction status from "starting" to "succeeded"
- **Polling completion detection**: Enhanced debugging shows polling now correctly detects completed photos and stops immediately
- **Root cause identification**: Confirmed that webhook reliability is critical for proper database updates when Replicate processing completes
- **Polling architecture corrected**: Implemented proper polling-only architecture for Replicate status updates, eliminating webhook dependencies
- **Automatic database synchronization**: `/api/predictions/by-batch/[batchId]` endpoint now automatically polls Replicate API for non-final predictions and updates database
- **End-to-end polling flow**: Frontend → Our API → Replicate API → Database Update → Frontend, ensuring real-time status synchronization

## [2025-06-19] - UI/UX Bug Fixes for Payment Success Page

### Fixed

## [2024-12-19] - Payment Success Page Complete Redesign

### Fixed
- **Resolved TypeScript Prop Mismatches in `app/payment-success/page.tsx`**: Fixed all remaining TypeScript compilation errors by correcting component prop interfaces:
  - Updated `RestoredPhotoCard` usage to pass a `photo` object with nested properties (`id`, `beforeSrc`, `afterSrc`, `title`, `description`) instead of individual props, and corrected callback signatures for `onImageClick` and `onShareClick`.
  - Changed `confirmButtonText` prop to `buttonText` in `EmailConfirmationModal` to match the component's actual interface.
  - Fixed `altText` prop to `alt` in `BeforeAfterSlider` component to match the expected prop name.
  - Resolved React hooks warning by copying `intervalRef.current` to a local variable in the useEffect cleanup function to avoid stale closure issues.
- The payment success page now compiles without TypeScript errors and maintains all functionality for photo restoration display, email sharing, and download actions.

### Changed
- Updated `app/api/replicate/predictions/[id]/route.ts` to include `original_image_url` (from `dbPrediction`), `restored_image_url` (using `finalRestoredImageUrl` which holds the direct Supabase URL of the uploaded restored image), and `logo_url` in the `dynamicData` for the Restoration Complete email. This allows images to be displayed inline in the SendGrid template.
- Modified Supabase queries in the Replicate webhook (`app/api/replicate/predictions/[id]/route.ts`) to select `input_image_url` from the `predictions` table and `image_batch_id` from the `orders` table to support these changes.
- Imported `serverConfig` into `app/api/replicate/predictions/[id]/route.ts` for constructing URLs.
- Fixed lint errors in `app/api/replicate/predictions/[id]/route.ts` related to `serverConfig` import, ensuring `orderData` fetches `image_batch_id`, and using `finalRestoredImageUrl` for the restored image URL.
- Updated button text on the payment success page (`app/payment-success/page.tsx`) from "Return to Homepage" to "Share with Family".
- Modified the "Share with Family" button on `app/payment-success/page.tsx` to open the email sharing modal instead of navigating to the homepage.
- Refactored email modal logic on `app/payment-success/page.tsx`: introduced `currentActionType` state to differentiate between 'download' and 'share' actions. Updated `handleDownloadClick`, button `onClick` handlers, and `handleConfirmDownload` to use this context. This resolves the 'No image selected' error for the 'Share with Family' button and prepares for distinct email sending logic.
- Created new API endpoint `app/api/send-photo-links/route.ts` to handle sending emails for both 'download' and 'share' actions, using appropriate SendGrid templates and dynamic data.
- Updated `handleConfirmDownload` in `app/payment-success/page.tsx` to call the `/api/send-photo-links` endpoint, passing the necessary data and handling success/error responses with toasts.
- Refactored `components/restoration/email-confirmation-modal.tsx` to be more dynamic. It now accepts `title`, `description`, and `buttonText` props, and the primary action callback is simplified to `onConfirm`. Removed all internal logic that opened new tabs.
- Updated `components/restoration/restored-photo-card.tsx` to replace the individual 'Download' button with a 'Share with Family' button. The component's props and event handler were updated to pass both original and restored image URLs for the share action.
- Performed a major refactor on `app/payment-success/page.tsx` to align with new component props and user requirements. This includes new state management for modal content and target photos, new event handlers for single-share, all-share, and all-download actions, and updated logic to pass dynamic content to the `EmailConfirmationModal`.
- **Fixed & Refactored `app/payment-success/page.tsx`**: Replaced the entire corrupted file with a clean, stable version. The new component correctly handles state management for photo restorations, polling, and user interactions. This resolves all previous JSX and TypeScript errors and provides a much more robust implementation.

### Changed
- Fixed an issue where SendGrid template IDs (Order Confirmation, Restoration Complete, Family Share) were not being loaded into the server configuration from environment variables. They are now correctly loaded in `lib/config.server.ts`.
- Noted requirement for `SENDGRID_ORDER_CONFIRMATION_TEMPLATE_ID` and `SENDGRID_RESTORATION_COMPLETE_TEMPLATE_ID` environment variables for email functionality.
- Updated order status in Stripe webhook handler from 'paid' to 'completed' to align with valid `order_status_enum` values.
- Aligned Stripe webhook `orders` table interactions with database schema: ensured all references (insert, select, data access) use `amount` instead of `total_amount` in `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`.
- Fixed Stripe webhook failure by correcting the metadata key for batch ID in `app/api/checkout/route.ts` from `imageBatchId` to `batch_id` to match the expectation of the webhook handler (`app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`).
- **Stripe Webhook Consolidation & Idempotency:**
  - Aligned Stripe webhook processing to a single endpoint: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`.
  - Moved and consolidated logic from `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` into the new unified handler.
  - Integrated order creation, Replicate prediction initiation, and order confirmation email sending into the unified handler.
  - Implemented an idempotency check using `stripe_payment_intent_id` in `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` to prevent duplicate order creation.
  - Removed `checkout.session.completed` event handling from `app/api/webhook/route.ts` to avoid redundant processing.
  - Fixed a lint error in `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` by declaring `listData` at a higher scope to ensure it's accessible for email attachment logic.
- Configured and successfully tested SendGrid for email delivery.
- Corrected Restoration Complete email logic (`app/api/replicate/predictions/[id]/route.ts`) to properly fetch `customer_email` from `orders` table and `input_image_url` (for original images) from `predictions` table using `order_id`. This fixes a previous unsuccessful modification.
- **Payment Success Page Complete Fix**: Replaced the entire corrupted `app/payment-success/page.tsx` component with a new, robust implementation. This resolves all outstanding JSX and TypeScript errors, fixes type mismatches in event handlers, and ensures stable polling and state management for photo restorations.
