## 📚 **BEST PRACTICES & LEARNINGS**

*This section documents key learnings, patterns, and best practices discovered during development. Updated continuously as new insights emerge.*

### **Database Design & Queries**

#### **Multiple Foreign Key Relationships**
**Problem**: When a table has multiple foreign keys to the same table, Supabase queries can become ambiguous.
**Example**: `restoration_jobs` table has both `original_image_id` and `restored_image_id` pointing to `images.id`

**Solutions**:
1. **Explicit Relationship Naming**: 
   ```typescript
   .select('*, images!restoration_jobs_original_image_id_fkey(*)')
   ```
2. **Two-Step Query Approach**:
   ```typescript
   // Step 1: Get specific IDs
   const imageIds = await getImageIdsForOrder(orderId);
   // Step 2: Query using those IDs
   const jobs = await getJobsByImageIds(imageIds);
   ```

**Prevention**: Always test queries with multiple records to catch cross-contamination.

#### **Environment Variable Management**
**Learning**: Use Doppler for all secrets, not `.env.local` files in production-like environments.
**Best Practice**: 
- Development: Use Doppler with `doppler run -- command`
- Testing: Implement test mode flags (`REPLICATE_TEST_STATUS`) for API cost control
- Documentation: Always document which environment variables control behavior

#### **API Error Handling**
**Pattern**: Structured error responses with detailed logging
```typescript
try {
  // API operation
} catch (error) {
  logger.error({ error, context }, 'Operation failed');
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'User-friendly message',
    details: isDev ? error.message : undefined 
  }, { status: 500 });
}
```

#### **Polling & Real-time Updates**
**Learning**: Conservative polling intervals prevent API overload
**Best Practice**:
- Start with 5-second intervals
- Use exponential backoff (max 30 seconds)
- Remove polling state from React dependency arrays to prevent infinite loops
- Implement test modes for immediate completion during development

#### **TypeScript & Type Safety**
**Pattern**: Always use proper type guards for JSON database columns
```typescript
// Bad
const url = job.metadata.output_url; // Runtime error if property doesn't exist

// Good  
const url = job.metadata?.output_url || null;
```

#### **Testing Strategy**
**Learning**: Test with multiple entities to catch relationship bugs
**Best Practice**:
- Create multiple orders/users in tests
- Verify data isolation between entities
- Test edge cases (empty results, failed states)
- Use real integration tests with Stripe CLI for webhooks

### Fixed
- **Critical Restoration Processing Issue**: Fixed restoration jobs not being started after order creation (2025-01-21T15:35:00+05:30)
  - Added direct restoration trigger function in Stripe webhook handler to immediately process pending restoration jobs
  - Restoration jobs were being created with 'pending' status but never submitted to Replicate API
  - Replaced complex RestorationWorker with simple triggerRestorationForOrder function that directly submits to Replicate
  - Fixed import path for supabaseAdmin and TypeScript errors in order status API
  - Now automatically starts restoration processing after webhook creates jobs, ensuring Replicate predictions begin immediately
  - Fixes orders stuck in processing status with 0% progress
- **Critical Polling Issue**: Fixed infinite polling loop in payment success page (2025-01-21T15:30:00+05:30)
  - Removed `poller` from useEffect dependency array which was causing multiple polling instances
  - Each poller state change was triggering creation of new poller, leading to exponential polling frequency
  - Now correctly creates single polling instance that respects conservative intervals (5s initial, 30s max)
  - Fixes excessive API calls to `/api/orders/lookup` and `/api/orders/[id]/status`
- **Email Modal 500 Errors**: Fixed "Send to me" and "Send to family" email modal POST requests failing with 500 Internal Server Error
  - **Root Cause**: Email type mismatch between API route (`share_photos`) and database enum (`share_family`)
  - **Solution**: Updated `/api/orders/[id]/share/route.ts` to use `share_family` email type
  - **Solution**: Updated email worker to handle `share_family` instead of `share_photos`
  - **Solution**: Removed unused `sendgridTemplateId` parameter from queueEmail call
  - **Impact**: Share functionality now works correctly for both "Send to me" and "Send to family" modals
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T20:00:00+05:30
- **Logo File Verification**: Verified logo file accessibility and URL construction
  - **Status**: Logo file exists at `public/images/logo.png` and is properly served by Next.js
  - **URL Construction**: Uses `${serverConfig.app.url}/images/logo.png` pattern in SendGrid emails
  - **Requirement**: Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` environment variable is set in production
  - **Test Result**: Logo accessible at `http://localhost:3001/images/logo.png` (200 OK, 29.4KB PNG)
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T20:03:00+05:30
- **Share Modal Sender Name Fix**: Fixed sender name not being passed through in share emails
  - **Root Cause**: `sharerName` from ShareModal was not being sent to API or used in email template
  - **Solution**: Updated payment success page to pass `sharerName` to `sharePhotos` function
  - **Solution**: Updated `sharePhotos` function type to accept optional `sharerName` parameter
  - **Solution**: Updated share API route to use `sharerName` for `sender_name` in email template data
  - **Solution**: Updated email subject to use `sharerName` when provided
  - **Impact**: Share emails now correctly display the custom sender name ({{sender_name}}) entered in the modal

  - **Solution**: Updated download functions to use `arrayBuffer()` and create `Blob` with explicit `image/png` MIME type
  - **Solution**: Applied fix to both single photo download and bulk ZIP download functions
  - **Impact**: Downloaded files now correctly have PNG format and proper file association
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T21:00:00+05:30
- **ZIP Download Error Fix**: Fixed "No download URL provided" error in payment success page ZIP download
  - **Root Cause**: Payment success page was using incomplete server-side ZIP API that had commented-out functionality
  - **Solution**: Replaced server-side `downloadPhotosZip` API call with client-side ZIP creation using JSZip
  - **Solution**: Updated payment success page to use same approach as ActionPanel for consistent behavior
  - **Solution**: Removed dependency on `/api/orders/[id]/download` endpoint which was not fully implemented
  - **Impact**: ZIP download now works correctly from payment success page with proper PNG files
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T21:02:00+05:30

  - **Impact**: Reduced API calls and server load while maintaining reasonable user experience
  - **Impact**: Both upload page and payment success page now poll restoration status once per minute
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T21:16:00+05:30
- **Server-Side Worker Polling Update**: Updated RestorationWorker background polling to 1 minute
  - **Root Cause**: Server-side RestorationWorker was polling every 30 seconds causing frequent API calls
  - **Changes**: Updated RestorationWorker constructor default pollInterval from 30000ms to 60000ms
  - **Context**: These are background workers that run server-side, separate from client-side polling
  - **Context**: Workers auto-start in production and handle job processing and email sending
  - **Impact**: Reduced server-side API calls to Replicate and database queries
  - **Impact**: EmailWorker already had 1-minute interval, now both workers are consistent
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T22:07:00+05:30
- **Webhook-Aware Polling**: Eliminated redundant API calls by making polling webhook-aware
  - **Root Cause**: Polling worker was calling Replicate API for same prediction IDs that webhooks handle
  - **Root Cause**: Both systems monitored identical prediction IDs causing duplicate API calls
  - **Solution**: Added webhook detection logic to skip polling when webhooks are working
  - **Solution**: Polling now only acts as fallback when no webhook received in 5 minutes
  - **Changes**: Added last_webhook_received timestamp check in pollJobStatus method
  - **Impact**: Dramatically reduced redundant Replicate API calls while maintaining reliability
  - **Impact**: Webhooks provide real-time updates, polling provides safety net for missed webhooks
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T22:14:00+05:30
- **Stuck Job Auto-Cleanup**: Added automatic cleanup for jobs stuck without external_id
  - **Root Cause**: Jobs without external_id (Replicate prediction ID) get stuck in processing status
  - **Root Cause**: Worker keeps finding these jobs but cannot poll Replicate without external_id
  - **Solution**: Added 1-hour timeout for jobs stuck without external_id
  - **Solution**: Automatically mark stuck jobs as failed to prevent infinite polling
  - **Changes**: Added time-based cleanup logic in pollJobStatus method
  - **Impact**: Prevents stuck jobs from causing constant worker activity
  - **Impact**: Reduces unnecessary database queries and log spam
  - **Timestamp**: 2025-06-20T22:16:00+05:30

## [2025-06-20] - Database Relationship Fix

### Fixed
- **Database Schema Relationship Issue**: Fixed invalid foreign key relationship in `getOrderById` function that was causing order status API to fail with PostgREST schema cache errors
  - Removed direct `restoration_jobs` join from `orders` table query since no direct foreign key exists
  - Relationship path is correctly handled as: `orders` → `images` → `restoration_jobs`
  - Order status API now uses separate `getRestorationJobsByOrder` function which properly joins through `images` table
- **Stripe Webhook Integration**: Fixed PostgreSQL ambiguous column reference in `generate_order_number` function
  - Qualified column reference as `orders.order_number` to resolve database error 42702
  - Stripe webhook now successfully creates orders, moves images, creates restoration jobs, and queues emails
  - Order lookup API now returns 200 instead of 404 after successful payment
- **Excessive API Polling Issue**: Implemented proper polling/retry logic as per polling-retry-implementation-plan
  - Created retry utility with exponential backoff for all API calls and database operations
  - Updated `OrderRestorationPoller` with more conservative polling intervals (5s initial, 30s max)
  - Reduced excessive order status API calls by implementing proper backoff when no changes detected
  - Added retry logic with exponential backoff for all 3rd party API calls (Stripe, Replicate, Supabase)
  - Improved error handling and timeout management for polling operations
  - **Timestamp: 2025-06-20T15:00:10+05:30** - Fixed hardcoded polling intervals to ensure conservative polling is actually applied

## [2025-06-20T15:34:14+05:30] - CRITICAL FIX: Restoration Jobs Database Relationship

### Fixed
- **Database Relationship Ambiguity**: Fixed Supabase query in `triggerRestorationForOrder` function that was failing due to multiple foreign key relationships between `restoration_jobs` and `images` tables
- **Restoration Job Processing**: Restoration jobs now properly transition from `pending` to `processing` status with correct `external_job_id` from Replicate API
- **Replicate API Integration**: Confirmed Replicate API calls are working with correct model schema (`flux-kontext-apps/restore-image`)

### Technical Details
- **Model Version**: Using specific version ID `85ae46551612b8f778348846b6ce1ce1b340e384fe2062399c0c412be29e107d`
- **Webhook Events**: Filtering for `["completed"]` events only
- **API Format**: Following Replicate HTTP API documentation exactly

### Impact
- Order 20250620-000007 restoration job successfully submitted to Replicate with prediction ID: `5s27mrhgfsrm80cqhk6b0ra1m4`
- Restoration processing now works end-to-end from webhook → job creation → Replicate submission
- Order status polling should now show actual progress instead of staying at 0%

## [2025-06-20T15:37:45+05:30] - TEST MODE: Replicate API Mock Functionality

### Added
- **Test Mode Control**: Implemented comprehensive test mode for Replicate API integration
  - **Environment Variable**: `REPLICATE_TEST_STATUS` controls real vs mock API usage
  - **Logic**: Set to `TRUE` for real Replicate API, any other value uses mock responses
  - **Coverage**: Applied to all Replicate API call locations:
    - `lib/restoration/trigger.ts` (already had test mode)
    - `lib/workers/restoration-worker.ts` (added test mode)
    - `app/api/replicate/initiate-restoration/route.ts` (added test mode)

### Fixed
- **Mock Response Generation**: Standardized mock prediction responses across all API endpoints
  - **Mock Image URL**: Uses local showcase image for testing
  - **Mock Prediction ID**: Generates unique mock IDs with timestamp and random suffix
  - **Mock Status**: Always returns 'succeeded' status for consistent testing
  - **Mock URLs**: Provides realistic prediction URL structure

### Technical Details
- **Current Setting**: `REPLICATE_TEST_STATUS=false` (mock mode enabled)
- **Real API Usage**: Set `REPLICATE_TEST_STATUS=TRUE` to use actual Replicate API
- **Mock Image**: Uses `/images/showcase-scratches-after.png` for test responses
- **Logging**: Clear distinction between real API and mock usage in logs

- **Development**: Faster development cycle with instant mock responses
- **Debugging**: Easier to debug webhook and restoration flows without API delays

## [2025-06-20T15:44:55+05:30] - CRITICAL FIX: Database Relationship Ambiguity Resolution

### Fixed
- **Order Status API Cross-Contamination**: Fixed critical bug where order status API was returning restoration jobs from ALL orders instead of just the requested order
- **Database Query Ambiguity**: Resolved Supabase query ambiguity caused by `restoration_jobs` table having two foreign keys to `images` table
- **Polling Data Accuracy**: Order polling now shows correct counts (1 job instead of 9 for single-image orders)

### Root Cause
The `restoration_jobs` table has two relationships with `images`:
- `original_image_id` → `images.id` (input image)
- `restored_image_id` → `images.id` (output image)

When using `.eq('images.order_id', orderId)`, Supabase couldn't determine which relationship to use, causing cross-order data leakage.

### Solution Implemented
**Two-Step Query Approach:**
1. First query: Get all image IDs for the specific order
2. Second query: Get restoration jobs using `.in('original_image_id', imageIds)`

### Files Modified
- `lib/db/restoration-jobs.ts`: Fixed `getRestorationJobsByOrder()` and `getPendingRestorationJobs()`
- `lib/restoration/trigger.ts`: Already fixed with explicit relationship naming

### Prevention Strategy
- **Explicit Relationship Naming**: Use `images!restoration_jobs_original_image_id_fkey` format
- **Two-Step Queries**: Avoid complex joins when relationship ambiguity exists
- **Testing Protocol**: Always test with multiple orders to catch cross-contamination
- **Code Documentation**: Document tables with multiple foreign keys to same table

### Impact
- Order status polling now shows accurate progress for individual orders
- Prevents users from seeing other users' restoration job statuses
- Eliminates false "processing" states from unrelated orders
- Fixes infinite polling loops caused by incorrect job counts

## [2025-06-20T15:49:36+05:30] - DATABASE CLEANUP: Cleared All Pending/Processing Jobs

### Maintenance
- **Job Status Cleanup**: Updated all pending and processing restoration jobs to completed status
- **Clean Slate**: Cleared 7 jobs (5 pending + 2 processing) from orders 20250620-000001 through 000008
- **Mock Completion**: Added mock output URLs and test mode flags to maintain data consistency

### Jobs Cleared
- **Pending Jobs**: 5 jobs from orders 000001-000005 (no external IDs)
- **Processing Jobs**: 2 jobs from orders 000007-000008 (with real Replicate prediction IDs)
- **External IDs**: Generated cleanup IDs for pending jobs, preserved real Replicate IDs for processing jobs

### Current Database State
- **Total Jobs**: 10
- **Completed Jobs**: 10 (100%)
- **Processing Jobs**: 0
- **Pending Jobs**: 0
- **Failed Jobs**: 0

### Impact
- Clean environment for testing new orders without interference from old jobs
- All orders now show completed status for consistent UI testing
- Preserved real Replicate prediction IDs for reference
- Ready for fresh end-to-end workflow testing

  - **Issue**: Inconsistent folder patterns between StorageService and Webhook handler
    - StorageService used: `uploads/restored/{orderId}/`
    - Webhook handler used: `restored/{jobId}/`
  - **Solution**: Updated webhook handler to use consistent pattern `uploads/restored/{orderId}/`
  - **Benefits**: Maintains logical folder hierarchy (`uploads/temp/`, `uploads/originals/`, `uploads/restored/`)

### Updated
- **Database Query**: Enhanced `getRestorationJobByExternalId` to include order_id relationship
  - Added join with images table to retrieve order_id for folder path generation
  - Enables webhook handler to create properly structured storage paths

### Technical Details

  ```
  photos/
  ├── uploads/
  │   ├── temp/{sessionId}/           # Temporary uploads before payment
  │   ├── originals/{orderId}/        # Original images after payment
  │   └── restored/{orderId}/         # Restored images (consistent across all code)
  ```
- **Bucket Consistency**: All storage operations use `'photos'` bucket
- **Path Generation**: Webhook handler now extracts orderId from job.images.order_id relationship

### Impact
- Clean environment for testing new orders without interference from old jobs
- All orders now show completed status for consistent UI testing

## [2025-06-20T17:10:15+05:30] - Before-After Slider Original Image Fix

### Fixed
- **Original Image Display**: Fixed before-after slider not displaying original images properly
  - **Root Cause**: `original_image_url` was missing from restoration job metadata
  - **Stripe Webhook**: Added `original_image_url` to metadata when creating restoration jobs
  - **Restoration Worker**: Ensured `original_image_url` is preserved and set in metadata during job processing
  - **Fallback Logic**: Uses `input_parameters.input_image` as fallback if metadata doesn't contain `original_image_url`

### Enhanced
- **Metadata Consistency**: Improved metadata handling across restoration job lifecycle
  - **Job Creation**: Original image URL stored in metadata during Stripe webhook processing
  - **Job Processing**: Original image URL preserved when marking job as processing
  - **Job Completion**: Original image URL maintained when marking job as completed
  - **Data Transformation**: Order status API now correctly maps original image URLs for components

### Technical Details
- **Stripe Webhook**: `moveResult.publicUrl` stored as `original_image_url` in job metadata
- **Restoration Worker**: Preserves existing metadata and adds fallback logic
- **Order Status API**: Uses `metadata.original_image_url` for `originalImageUrl` field
- **Component Compatibility**: Ensures `InteractiveViewer` receives correct original image URLs

### Benefits
- **Working Slider**: Before-after slider now properly displays original images on the left
- **Data Integrity**: Consistent original image URL storage across all restoration jobs
- **Backward Compatibility**: Fallback logic handles existing jobs without metadata
- **User Experience**: Users can now properly compare original vs restored images

## [2025-06-20T17:12:00+05:30] - Database Query Fix for Restoration Worker

### Fixed
- **Database Error**: Fixed "column images_1.filename does not exist" error in restoration worker
  - **Root Cause**: SQL query in `getRestorationJobsByStatus` referenced non-existent `filename` column
  - **Solution**: Replaced `filename` with `storage_path` which exists in the images table schema
  - **Impact**: Restoration worker can now properly fetch pending jobs without database errors

### Technical Details
- **Function**: `getRestorationJobsByStatus` in `lib/db/restoration-jobs.ts`
- **Error Code**: PostgreSQL error 42703 (undefined column)
- **Table Schema**: Images table contains `storage_path`, `public_url`, `id`, `order_id` but no `filename`
- **Query Fix**: Updated SELECT statement to use existing columns only

### Benefits
- **Worker Stability**: Restoration worker no longer crashes on database queries
- **Error Resolution**: Eliminated recurring "column does not exist" errors in logs
- **System Health**: Workers can now properly process restoration jobs
- **Data Integrity**: Queries now align with actual database schema

## [2025-06-20T17:14:00+05:30] - Email Worker Fixes and Stabilization

### Fixed
- **Email Worker Function Import**: Fixed missing `getEmailsByStatus` function by using the correct `getPendingEmails` function from email-queue.ts
- **Email Status Enum**: Fixed invalid `'processing'` email status to use valid `'sending'` status from database enum
- **SendGrid Function Calls**: Fixed email worker to properly call appropriate SendGrid functions:
  - `sendOrderConfirmationEmail` for order confirmation emails
  - `sendRestorationCompleteEmail` for restoration complete emails  
  - `sendPhotosToFamilyEmail` for share photos emails
- **Function Return Types**: Fixed email worker to handle void return types from SendGrid functions instead of expecting messageId/id properties
- **Database Field Names**: Fixed retry logic to use correct database field names (`attempt_number` instead of `retry_count`, `scheduled_for` instead of `retry_at`)
- **Function Parameters**: Fixed SendGrid function calls to use correct interface parameters (`dynamicData` object instead of individual `toName`, `subject`, `templateId` properties)

### Technical Details
- Email worker was logging empty error objects due to calling non-existent `getEmailsByStatus` function
- All SendGrid functions return `Promise<void>`, not objects with messageId/id properties
- Database email_status_enum only supports: "pending", "sending", "sent", "failed", "bounced"
- Fixed TypeScript type mismatches and property access errors

## [2025-06-20T18:16:00+05:30] - Email Customer Name Fix

### Fixed
- **Email Customer Name Source**: Fixed restoration worker accessing non-existent `order.customer_name` and `order.customer_email` fields
- **Database Join Access**: Updated to properly access customer data from joined `customers` table (`order.customers.name`, `order.customers.email`)
- **Customer Name Fallback**: Implemented "Valued customer" fallback when customer name is not available
- **Consistent Naming**: Applied same fallback logic to both order confirmation and restoration complete emails

### Technical Details
- **Issue**: Restoration worker was accessing `order.customer_name` which doesn't exist (returns `undefined`)
- **Root Cause**: Customer data is in joined `customers` table, not direct order fields
- **Solution**: Use `order.customers?.name` and `order.customers?.email` with "Valued customer" fallback
- **Database Structure**: Orders table has `customer_id` (foreign key), customer details in separate `customers` table
- **Email Fields**: `toName` and `dynamicData.customer_name` now properly populated

### Impact
- ✅ Restoration complete emails now have proper customer names in "To" field
- ✅ Email templates receive correct customer_name in dynamic data
- ✅ Consistent fallback behavior across all email types
- ✅ No more `undefined` or empty customer names in emails
